# Turtle programming
A fun way to get into programming. Run the example with
```Powershell
> Python Turtle.py
```
It's the same as those robots from early 2000 school IT lessons.

### How to use the Turtle 

Initialise a turtle with
```Python
t = _turtle()
```
Use these commands to interact with it:

- Move the turtle 100 units forward
```Python
t.move(100)
```
- Rotate the turtle **clockwise** in **radians** (pi is 180)
```Python
t.turn(np.pi) 
```
